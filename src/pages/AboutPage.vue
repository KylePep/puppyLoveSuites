        Welcome to Puppy Love Suites, where every tail wags with joy! Owned and lovingly managed by Rebecca Peppersack,
        our facility is more than just a place for dogs to stay – it's a home away from home.

      Rebecca's passion for animals runs deep. As a lifelong dog lover and owner, she understands the importance of
      providing a safe, comfortable, and nurturing environment for our canine companions. With a background in the
      veterinary industry (managing a veterinary hospital in Boise) and a commitment to excellence, Rebecca ensures that
      every dog who walks through our doors receives the same level of love and attention they would at home.

      live onsite, offering round-the-clock supervision and care for our furry guests. This unique setup allows us to
      maintain a warm and welcoming atmosphere, where dogs feel like part of the family from the moment they arrive.
